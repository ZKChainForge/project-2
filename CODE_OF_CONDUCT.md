**You don't need to be the target to report.** If you witness behavior that affects others, please report it.

---

## Conflict Resolution

Not all conflicts are Code of Conduct violations. We encourage resolving disagreements constructively when possible.

### Informal Resolution

For minor interpersonal conflicts:

#### Step 1: Direct Communication

If safe and appropriate, try to resolve the issue directly:

1. **Choose the right moment**: Find a private, calm setting
2. **Use "I" statements**: Focus on how you feel, not blame
3. **Be specific**: Describe the behavior, not the person
4. **Listen actively**: Seek to understand their perspective
5. **Find common ground**: Look for solutions that work for both

**Example**: "I felt frustrated when my questions were dismissed in the meeting. Could we find a better way to discuss concerns?"

#### Step 2: Seek Peer Support

If direct communication doesn't work:

1. **Talk to a trusted community member**: Get perspective
2. **Consider involving a neutral third party**: Informal mediation
3. **Document the issue**: Keep notes of what's happening

#### Step 3: Escalate if Needed

If informal approaches don't work:

1. **Contact a maintainer**: They can provide guidance
2. **File a formal report**: If it's a Code of Conduct issue
3. **Disengage if necessary**: Your well-being comes first

### Formal Resolution

For more serious conflicts or when informal resolution fails:

#### Requesting Mediation

1. Contact conduct@zk-arithmos.dev
2. Explain the conflict and what you've tried
3. Request mediation services

#### Formal Complaint

If the conflict involves Code of Conduct violations:

1. File a formal report
2. Follow the investigation process
3. Participate as requested

### Mediation

For conflicts that aren't Code of Conduct violations but need help to resolve:

#### When Mediation Helps

- Personality conflicts affecting collaboration
- Disagreements about project direction
- Communication breakdowns
- Minor disputes that have escalated

#### Mediation Process

1. **Request**: Either party requests mediation
2. **Agreement**: Both parties agree to participate
3. **Mediator selection**: Neutral community member selected
4. **Session(s)**: Structured conversation(s) to resolve issues
5. **Agreement**: Parties agree on path forward
6. **Follow-up**: Check-in to ensure resolution holds

#### Mediation Principles

- **Voluntary**: Both parties must agree to participate
- **Confidential**: What's discussed stays private
- **Neutral**: Mediator doesn't take sides
- **Future-focused**: Goal is resolution, not blame
- **Good faith**: Both parties must engage honestly

#### Mistakes Happen

1. **Apologize sincerely**: "I'm sorry, I was wrong to say that"
2. **Learn from it**: Understand what you did wrong
3. **Do better**: Apply what you learned going forward

### Bystander Intervention

When you witness unacceptable behavior:

#### Choosing Your Approach
